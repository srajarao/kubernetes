# Kubernetes Agent Setup Script for AGX Device
# 
# This script sets up the AGX device as a k3s agent to join the tower's cluster.
# Based on proven working AGX setup - customized for AGX-specific requirements.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Tower must be running k3s server
# 2. Network connectivity to tower
# 3. Agent tokens available in shared storage
#
# Usage:
#   ./k3s-agx-setup.sh          # Full AGX agent setup
#   DEBUG=1 ./k3s-agx-setup.sh  # Debug mode with verbose output
