# Kubernetes Agent Setup Script for Nano Device
# 
# This script sets up the Nano device as a k3s agent to join the tower's cluster.
# Based on proven AGX setup but customized for Nano-specific requirements.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Tower must be running k3s server
# 2. Network connectivity to tower
# 3. Agent tokens available in shared storage
# 4. NVIDIA drivers installed (for GPU workloads)
#
# Usage:
#   ./k3s-nano-setup.sh          # Full Nano agent setup
#   DEBUG=1 ./k3s-nano-setup.sh  # Debug mode with verbose output
