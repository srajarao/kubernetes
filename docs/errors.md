# K3s Deployment Error Analysis

## Current Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**Latest Update (October 10, 2025)**: All agent connectivity issues have been resolved. The cluster is now fully operational with all nodes showing as "Ready" and applications running successfully.

---

## Log File: final_verification_output_20251010_132046.log

### Summary
This log captured critical connectivity issues between K3s agents (nano and AGX) and the server (tower). The primary problems were network connectivity failures and API server readiness issues, preventing proper cluster formation.

**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED** - Agents now connect properly to tower server.

---

## üî¥ Critical Errors (RESOLVED)

### **Agent-Server Connection Failures (FIXED)**
**Error Type**: Connection Refused
**Frequency**: Continuous throughout log
**Impact**: Agents cannot join cluster, preventing multi-node deployment
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Timeline**: 13:24:XX - 13:26:46 (during/after agent reinstallation)

**Root Cause**: Agents were installed/restarted without proper K3S_URL environment variable loading by systemd.

**Original Error Messages**:
```
Failed to connect to proxy. Root cause: connect: connection refused
dial tcp 10.1.10.150:6443: connect: connection refused
```

**Affected Components**:
- **nano agent**: Cannot connect to tower server
- **AGX agent**: Cannot connect to tower server

### **API Server Readiness Issues (FIXED)**
**Error Type**: APIServer Not Ready
**Frequency**: ~100+ occurrences
**Impact**: Kubernetes resources cannot be watched/listed, cluster operations fail
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Timeline**: 13:24:XX - 13:26:46 (during/after agent reinstallation)

**Root Cause**: Agents trying to access local API server (127.0.0.1:6444) because they weren't configured as proper agents.

**Original Error Messages**:
```
"Failed to watch" err="apiserver not ready - error from a previous attempt: EOF"
"Failed to watch" err="failed to list *v1.Node: apiserver not ready"
```

**Affected Resources**:
- Nodes, Services, Pods, Endpoints, ConfigMaps
- CSI Drivers, Runtime Classes, Service CIDRs

### **Pod Synchronization Failures (FIXED)**
**Error Type**: Volume Mounting Issues
**Impact**: Application pods cannot start properly
**Status**: ‚úÖ **RESOLVED**
**Timeline**: 13:26:XX (during final verification)

**Original Error Message**:
```
"Error syncing pod, skipping" err="unmounted volumes=[kube-api-access-7wxrh], unattached volumes=[], failed to process volumes=[]: context canceled"
```

**Affected Pod**: postgres-db-67886d64bc-8vxbw

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Missing K3S_URL Environment Variable
The core problem was that **k3s-agent services were started without the K3S_URL environment variable properly loaded by systemd**, causing agents to run as standalone servers instead of connecting to the cluster.

**Why This Happened**:
1. Agent installation used `K3S_URL` in environment during install
2. But systemd service file didn't persist the environment variable
3. Service restarted without `K3S_URL`, defaulting to standalone server mode
4. Agent tried to start local API server at `127.0.0.1:6444`

**Evidence**:
```bash
# Service was running with:
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/k3s agent --node-ip 10.1.10.181  # ‚ùå No server URL

# Environment file existed but wasn't loaded:
K3S_URL='https://10.1.10.150:6443'  # ‚úÖ Correct URL present
```

### Secondary Issues:
- Network connectivity was actually working fine
- Firewall rules were correct
- DNS resolution was functional
- Only the systemd environment loading was broken

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Fixes Applied

### Immediate Resolution (13:27:XX):
1. **Created proper environment files** on agent nodes:
   ```bash
   echo 'K3S_TOKEN="K104dfc03e3ade4f5558f8adc20b0d2d239e62e61fadc3270823319d20f57415b8b::server:931e8edccb6a0fcdc5f5a360a34b503e"' | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/k3s-agent.service.env
   echo 'K3S_URL="https://10.1.10.150:6443"' | sudo tee -a /etc/systemd/system/k3s-agent.service.env
   ```

2. **Reloaded systemd configuration**:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl restart k3s-agent
   ```

3. **Updated automation script** (Steps 15 & 16) to prevent future occurrences:
   - Added environment file creation after agent installation
   - Added `systemctl daemon-reload && systemctl restart` after install
   - Ensured K3S_URL is properly loaded by systemd

### Verification (13:28:XX):
```bash
# Before fix:
kubectl get nodes
# Error: connection refused

# After fix:
kubectl get nodes
NAME    STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSION
agx     Ready    <none>                 37h     v1.33.5+k3s1
nano    Ready    <none>                 2d6h    v1.33.5+k3s1
tower   Ready    control-plane,master   2d15h   v1.33.5+k3s1
```

## üìÖ Detailed Timeline Analysis

**Log Generated**: October 10, 2025 at 13:20:46
**Error Period**: 13:20:46 - 13:26:46 (approximately 6 minutes)
**Peak Error Rate**: Continuous connection failures throughout
**Resolution Time**: ~5 minutes after applying fixes
**Final State**: ‚úÖ Cluster fully operational

### Step-by-Step Timeline:

**13:20:46** - **Script Start**: K3s automation script begins execution
**13:21:XX** - **Server Setup**: K3s server installation and configuration (Steps 1-7)
**13:22:XX** - **Agent Preparation**: SSH validation and network checks (Steps 8-12)
**13:23:XX** - **Agent Uninstallation**: Clean removal of existing agents (Steps 13-14)
**13:24:XX** - **Agent Reinstallation**: Fresh agent installation (Steps 15-16) ‚ö†Ô∏è **ERROR PERIOD STARTS**
**13:25:XX** - **Service Configuration**: Systemd overrides and registry setup (Steps 17-22)
**13:26:XX** - **Application Deployment**: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, pgAdmin deployment (Steps 23-45)
**13:26:46** - **Final Verification**: Log capture shows agent connectivity errors ‚ùå
**13:27:XX** - **Manual Fix Applied**: Environment files created, systemd reloaded ‚úÖ
**13:28:XX** - **Verification Complete**: All nodes show "Ready", cluster operational ‚úÖ

### Error Correlation:

- **13:24:XX-13:26:46**: Agent reinstallation without proper K3S_URL environment loading
- **13:26:46**: Log capture shows "Failed to connect to proxy" and "apiserver not ready" errors
- **13:27:XX**: Manual intervention fixes systemd environment loading
- **13:28:XX**: Errors cease, cluster becomes stable

### Key Insight:
The errors occurred immediately after **Step 16 (AGX Agent Reinstallation)** and persisted until manual systemd reload was applied. This confirms the root cause was improper environment variable loading after agent installation.

## üèóÔ∏è Prevention Measures

### Script Improvements:
- **Steps 15 & 16** now include proper environment file creation
- **Systemd reload** added after all agent installations
- **Environment validation** before service restart

### Monitoring:
- Agent logs no longer show connection errors
- All nodes maintain "Ready" status
- Pod scheduling works correctly
- Network connectivity stable
