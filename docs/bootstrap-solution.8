.SH NAME
bootstrap-solution \- Bootstrap problem solution for script executor deployment
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bootstrap-solution
.RB [ phase ]
.RB [ component ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual documents the solution to the bootstrap paradox in deploying the script executor system, providing a phased approach from native Python to containerized cluster management.
.SH THE BOOTSTRAP PARADOX
.SS The Problem
.nf
❌ PROBLEM: Project goal is to build containers & K8s
❌ But to run the management app, we need containers & K8s already working
❌ = Bootstrap paradox! Can't start without what we're trying to build!
.fi
.SS The Challenge
.TP
What we want to build
Containerized cluster management system
.TP
What we need to start
Container infrastructure
.TP
Result
Can't build what we need to start building!
.SH BOOTSTRAP SOLUTIONS
.SS Solution 1: Two-Phase Bootstrap (Recommended)
.nf
Phase 1: Non-Containerized Bootstrap
├── Run management app as native Python on tower
├── Use existing system (no containers needed)
├── Build and test container image
├── Deploy containerized version
└── Transition to Phase 2

Phase 2: Containerized Operations
├── Run management app in container
├── Full cluster management capabilities
├── Self-sustaining system
└── Can rebuild itself if needed
.fi
.SS Solution 2: Minimal Container-First Approach
.nf
1. Build container image manually (one-time)
2. Deploy basic container runtime
3. Use containerized app to build full K8s
4. Transition to full cluster management
.fi
.SS Solution 3: Hybrid Bootstrap Architecture
.nf
Bootstrap Components:
├── Native Python scripts (no containers)
├── Basic container building tools
├── Minimal K8s deployment scripts
└── Transition logic

Full System:
├── Containerized management app
├── Complete cluster operations
├── Self-management capabilities
└── Recovery and rebuild features
.fi
.SH RECOMMENDED BOOTSTRAP PATH
.SS Phase 1: Native Python Bootstrap (Start Here)
.nf
# On tower (existing system, no containers needed)
cd /home/sanjay/containers/kubernetes
git clone <script-executor-repo>  # or recreate files
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# Now you have working management interface!
# Use it to build containers and deploy K8s
.fi
.SS Phase 2: Container Building
.nf
# Using the web interface, execute scripts to:
# 1. Build script-executor container image
# 2. Deploy basic container runtime
# 3. Set up initial K8s components
# 4. Deploy containerized management app
.fi
.SS Phase 3: Full Cluster Management
.nf
# Containerized app now manages the full cluster
# Can rebuild itself and the entire cluster
# Self-sustaining management system
.fi
.SH BOOTSTRAP WORKFLOW
.SS Step 1: Start with What Exists
.nf
Existing: tower server with Python, scripts, basic tools
Goal: Get management interface running
Method: Native Python application (no containers)
.fi
.SS Step 2: Use Interface to Build Containers
.nf
Interface: Web UI for script execution
Actions: Execute container building scripts
Result: script-executor container image created
.fi
.SS Step 3: Deploy Containerized Version
.nf
Using: Native interface to deploy container
Result: Containerized app takes over management
Transition: Native → Containerized system
.fi
.SS Step 4: Full Cluster Building
.nf
Using: Containerized interface
Actions: Build complete K8s cluster
Result: Self-managing cluster system
.fi
.SH WHY THIS SOLVES THE BOOTSTRAP PROBLEM
.SS No Circular Dependencies
.TP
Start
Native Python (uses existing system)
.TP
Build
Containers (using native interface)
.TP
Deploy
Containerized app (using built containers)
.TP
Manage
Full cluster (using containerized interface)
.SS Progressive Enhancement
.TP
Phase 1
Basic management capabilities
.TP
Phase 2
Container building
.TP
Phase 3
Full cluster management
.TP
Phase 4
Self-sustaining system
.SS Reality-Aligned
.TP
Uses what exists
Tower server, Python, scripts
.TP
Builds what we need
Containers, K8s cluster
.TP
No assumptions
Doesn't require pre-existing containers
.SH THE CORRECT STARTING POINT
The right bootstrap approach:
.TP
Start with native Python
On existing tower server
.TP
Use web interface
To build container images
.TP
Deploy containerized version
Using the interface
.TP
Build full K8s cluster
With containerized management
.PP
This creates a true bootstrap path from zero infrastructure to full cluster management system.
